# Airport-Data-analysis---SQL-project-
This project involves analyzing an Airports Dataset using SQL to derive insights into air travel patterns, passenger traffic, and flight statistics.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about flights between different airports, including:

Origin & Destination Airports: Codes, city names, and geographical coordinates.
Passenger & Flight Details: Number of passengers, available seats, flights, and distance traveled.
Date & Population Data: Flight date and population of the origin and destination cities.
Columns in the Dataset
Column Name	Description
Origin_airport	3-letter airport code of the departure airport
Destination_airport	3-letter airport code of the arrival airport
Origin_city	City where the flight originates
Destination_city	City where the flight arrives
Passengers	Number of passengers on the flight
Seats	Number of available seats on the flight
Flights	Number of flights on the route
Distance	Distance between origin and destination (in miles)
Fly_date	Date of the flight
Origin_population	Population of the origin city
Destination_population	Population of the destination city
Org_airport_lat	Latitude of the origin airport
Org_airport_long	Longitude of the origin airport
Dest_airport_lat	Latitude of the destination airport
Dest_airport_long	Longitude of the destination airport
