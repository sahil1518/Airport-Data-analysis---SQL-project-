# Airport-Data-analysis---SQL-project-
This project involves analyzing an Airports Dataset using SQL to derive insights into air travel patterns, passenger traffic, and flight statistics.

Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about flights between different airports, including:
1. Origin & Destination Airports: Codes, city names, and geographical coordinates.
2. Passenger & Flight Details: Number of passengers, available seats, flights, and distance traveled.
3. Date & Population Data: Flight date and population of the origin and destination cities.
   Columns in the Dataset

some basic questions 

1. The objective is to calculate the total number of passengers for each pair of origin and destination airports.
2.  the goal is to calculate the average seat utilization for each flight by dividing the  number of passengers by the total number of seats available. 
3. The aim is to determine the top 5 origin and destination airport pairs that have the highest total passenger volume. 
4. The objective is to calculate the total number of flights and passengers departing from each origin city. 
5. The aim is to calculate the total distance flown by flights originating from each airport.
6. The objective is to group flights by month and year using the Fly_date column to calculate the number of flights,
  total passengers, and average distance traveled per month. 
7. The goal is to calculate the passenger-to-seats ratio for each origin and destination route
   and filter the results to display only those routes where this ratio is less than 0.5. 
8. The aim is to determine the top 3 origin airports with the highest frequency of flights. 
9. The objective is to identify the cities (excluding Bend, OR) that sends the most flights and passengers to Bend, OR. 
10. The aim is to identify the longest flight route in terms of distance traveled, including both the origin and destination airports. 

    hard Question 
1. The objective is to determine the most and least busy months by flight count across multiple years.
2. The aim is to calculate the year-over-year percentage growth in the total number of passengers for each origin and destination airport pair.
3. The objective is to identify routes (from origin to destination) that have demonstrated consistent year-over-year growth in the number of flights. 
4. The aim is to determine the top 3 origin airports with the highest weighted passenger-to-seats utilization ratio, 
   sidering the total number of flights for weighting.
5. The objective is to identify the peak traffic month for each origin city based on the highest number of passengers, 
   including any ties where multiple months have the same passenger count.
6. The aim is to identify the routes (origin-destination pairs) that have experienced the largest decline in passenger numbers year-over-year. 
7. The objective is to list all origin and destination airports that had at least 10 flights  but maintained an average seat utilization (passengers/seats) of less than 50%.  
8. The aim is to calculate the average flight distance for each unique city-to-city pair (origin and destination) 
   identify the routes with the longest average distance.
9. The objective is to calculate the total number of flights and passengers for each year,  along with the percentage growth in both flights and passengers compared to the previous year.   
10. The aim is to identify the top 3 busiest routes (origin-destination pairs) based on the total distance flown,
    weighted by the number of flights.
